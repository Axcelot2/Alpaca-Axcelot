# Includes several shell scripts we are going to implement in our program

- This project aims to retain and restore context between conversations with LLM's. 

- The choice of interface to run the LLM's is Ollama.

- Still a rough proof of concept (and will be used as a collaborative college project)

## Script descriptions

- save_conversation: Basic shell script that will save the entire conversation into a .txt file
- import_to_ollama: Will look for the .txt file created using (save_conversation) and import it into Ollama
