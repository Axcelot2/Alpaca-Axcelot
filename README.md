## Script descriptions

- save_conversation: Basic shell script that will save the entire conversation into a .txt file

### Sidenotes

- This project aims to retain and restore context between conversations with LLM's. 

- The choice of interface to run the LLM's is Ollama.

- Still a rough proof of concept (will be used as a collaborative college project)
