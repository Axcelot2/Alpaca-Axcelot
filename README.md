# Alpaca-Shellscripts

- This project aims to retain and restore context between conversations with LLM's. 

- The choice of interface to run the LLM's is Ollama.

- Still a rough proof of concept (and will be used as a collaborative college project)

## Script choice

Options were limited to basic Shell scripting or Python scripting in order to achieve any level of automation within the Ollama terminal. 

### Sidenotes

We are aware that there are more efficient ways to execute this project but as per our course limitations, we will be aiming to complete everything on C.
